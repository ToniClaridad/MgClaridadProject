      <p>Avatar: The Last Airbender is an American anime-influenced animated television series co-created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studios. The show aired from February 2005 to July 2008. Avatar is set in a world where people can telekinetically manipulate one of the four elements: water, earth, fire or air, through practices known as "bending", inspired by Chinese martial arts. The only individual who can bend all four elements, the "Avatar", is responsible for maintaining harmony among the world's four nations, and serves as the bridge between the physical world and the spirit world.
